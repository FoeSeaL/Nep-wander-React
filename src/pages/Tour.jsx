    <h2 className="fw-bold pt-3">Overview</h2>
    <p>The Nepal’s golden triangle tour is one of the best packages that cover almost all the popular tourist attractions of Nepal. The package will cover cultural and natural aspects that make Nepal one of the must-visit tourist destinations in the world.
      The trip starts with a guided sightseeing tour of some of the UNESCO World Heritage sites (Pashupatinath, Swoyambhunath, Bouddhanath and the Kathmandu Durbar Square) in the Kathmandu Valley that captivates you with the craftsmanship and mystery of centuries old architecture, history and culture. After the valley, we move towards the tropical low land, where another world heritage site ‘Chitwan National Park’ that protects over 932 sq km of sal forest, water swamps and elephant grassland is located. It is also one of the leading wildlife-viewing national parks in Asia, where one can spot 50 different species of mammals that include one-horned rhinos, deer, monkeys, royal Bengal Tiger, leopards, wild elephants, around 450 species of birds and 67 species of butterflies. An insight on the lifestyle and culture of the Tharu people (one of the largest ethnic groups in Nepal) is the additional benefit about this visit. Leaving the wildlife of Chitwan, we head towards a serene subtropical paradise that sits about 400m lower than Kathmandu and presents the masterpieces of mother nature for people looking to bask in the beauty of nature along with the peaceful countryside experience. With the stunning views of Annapurna massif and Machhapuchhre, this city of lakes exhibits mysterious caves, cascading waterfalls, historical temples and museums to make the day memorable. Enjoying the sunrise view from Sarangkot, we drive back to Kathmandu ending the 8 days Golden triangle tour.</p>

        <h5 className="fw-bold border-bottom-"> Day 2: Kathmandu
        </h5>
      </div>
      <p className="paddin"> A day to explore Kathmandu the capital city of Nepal. We organise a full day of guided sightseeing to the Buddhist and Hindu sights in Kathmandu, probably to Kathmandu’s Durbar Square, Swayambunath – the Buddhist monkey temple- and Pashupatinath a sacred Hindu temple complex on the banks of the Bagmati River. Three major towns are located in the valley, Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur, each having a great artistic and architectural tradition. Kathmandu is the capital and the largest city in the country. Patan, the second largest is separated from Kathmandu by a river. Bhaktapur, the third largest, is towards the eastern end of the valley and its relative isolation is reflected in its slower pace and more distinctly mediaeval atmosphere. In the Kathmandu Valley the landscape is dramatically sculpted by the contours of the paddy fields. The towns and villages are alive with the colours of farm produce, ranging from pyramids of golden grain to the vivid reds of chilli peppers laid out on mats to dry in the sun. In the streets and towns there is a constant bustle of activity, especially in the bazaars and markets where the farmers sell their vegetables and fruit. You will get back to the hotel after your sightseeing tour around mid-afternoon and the rest of the day is free for you to explore the city further and pack bags ready for the start of the trek the following morning. You can leave a bag at the hotel with items you will not need on the trek. Overnight at hotel in Kathmandu

        </h5>
      </div>
      <p className="paddin">Pokhara is the destination set for the day. However, before leaving Chitwan, we go for bird watching. After that, leaving Terai, we head towards the hills in Nepal, that is, we head towards Pokhara, situated 200kms west of Kathmandu and 4 hours from Chitwan. Enjoying the hills, river, vegetation and the settlement of people we reach Pokhara. We check into the hotel, freshen up and set off to explore the Lake area of Pokhara. We relax in a boat on the placid water of Phewa Tal, visit Barahi Temple or even try fishing. We also enjoy the night life in Pokhara. Overnight at hotel in Pokhara.
